# Middle Earth Optimal Path Finder

This project is developed as a part of the course CO222 Programming Methodology, focusing on practical applications of algorithms and optimization techniques in complex scenarios using the C programming language.

The objective is to assist Frodo Baggins and his fellowship in finding the minimum distance path through Middle-earth from a given starting point to a specified endpoint. The primary goal is to ensure they navigate their perilous journey efficiently while leveraging magical teleportation doors and overcoming various obstacles.
