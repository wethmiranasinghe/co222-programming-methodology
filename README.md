# Middle Earth Optimal Path Finder

This is a course project developed under CO222 Programming Methodology, focusing on practical applications of algorithms and optimization techniques in complex scenarios using the C programming language.

This is based on the fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. The objective is to assist Frodo Baggins and his fellowship in finding the minimum distance path through Middle-earth from a given starting point to a specified endpoint. The primary goal is to ensure they navigate their perilous journey efficiently while leveraging magical teleportation doors and overcoming various obstacles.
